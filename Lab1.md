1. Installing Visual Studio Code

For this first step, I did not need to install Visual Studio Code because it was already installed on my computer. 
But, to install Visual Studio Code, I would need to download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows and run the 
installer by selecting the Visual Studio Code installer from the start menu. After the program finishes installing,
I should be able open it up to this page: ![Image](VisCodeLab1.png)



2. Remotely Connecting

I did not need to install git for Windows, but it would be the first thing I need to do for this step. After git is installed, 
I would set my terminal in Visual Studio code to git bash and type ssh and my course account in the terminal, which would 
look like this: ssh cs15lsp23aa@ieng6.ucsd.edu. The terminal had a message pop up on my screen, asking me if I wanted to 
connect to the server. I typed yes and I had to input my password from my course account. Since I just created a password I had 
to wait a while to input my password. My screen had this message pop up after the password was typed:![Image](CommandsLab1.png)



3. Trying Some Commands

In the terminal I tried using some commands like, cd~, cd, and ls -lat. Nothing in my terminal popped up after trying the 
commands cd~ and cd. But after typing ls -lat, I had many directories and files pop up on my screen (which is shown in the 
image below). After trying different commands, I used Ctrl-D and typed the exit command to log out of the remote server.
